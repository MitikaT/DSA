starting from 0 the k-1th person is killed and kth person returned
the kth person becomes 0 in the next recursive call
to adjust this jos(n-1,k)+k is used 
to make sure the value is from 0 to n-1, %n is used

class Solution
{
    public:
    int jos(int n,int k){
        if(n==1)
            return 0;
        else
            return (jos(n-1,k)+k)%n;
    }
    int josephus(int n, int k)
    {
       return jos(n,k)+1;
    }
};
