https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

n-1's binary representation only has 1s after the place of the first 1 from the left in n
the rest of the bits are the same in n-1 and n 

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int bits=0;
        while(n>0){
            n=(n&(n-1));
            bits++;
        }
        return bits;
    }
};
